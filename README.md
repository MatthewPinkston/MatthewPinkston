- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MatthewPinkston

I regularly collaborate with Kennesaw to sponsor graduating students in completing a final capstone project for the University. One of these projects includes a software development effort to produce an IT Management solution for the market that is open source, complete, and fast. Being complete means having every possible feature you could imagine (or close to it) that an IT department may need. This includes asset and license tracking, issue management, knowledgebase, purchasing (tracking orders, etc.), labor management, and more.
